## Jammming

In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

This project doesn't work as expected, which I've communicated with forums for possible explanations and help. The JSX and React-specific syntax all works, but the first fetch method in the Spotify module's search method doesn't return a response.json as expected when searching for song results.
